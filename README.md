### Rule 2d

New Zealand Python User Group aims to foster an inclusive community which invites diverse groups of people from all backgrounds, regardless of age, body size, race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexuality, disability or religion to discuss and learn about all things Python in an environment of mutual respect, tolerance and encouragement.  Everyone has the right to feel safe and to be safe.

### Rule 2e

Rule 2d, and the New Zealand Python User Group Code of Conduct, shall be applied universally at all times to behaviour within Charity spaces and activities.

## Rule 3

In order to join the Charity one must complete a membership form, and payment for the yearly fees must be received within 90 days of the submission of the form. Failure to pay the fees within this time will result in the membership, and all membership benefits, being revoked. The fee is determined by the committee of the Charity and can be changed as the needs of the Charity change.

Membership is for the current financial year of the Charity. This is presently defined as being the year from the 1st of January to the 31st of December.

The Charity may designate certain benefits, areas, events, or other resources as Members Benefits, and restrict access to these for the benefit of current members.

Subscription, membership, or presence in any area operated by the New Zealand Python User Group does not imply membership of the Charity itself.

## Rule 4

### Rule 4a

A member can choose to leave the Charity at any time, without refund of their fees. The member wishing to leave must submit written notice (email or letter) to the committee to this effect. Non-payment of subscription fees will result in termination of membership and all associated benefits.

### Rule 4b

A member can be expelled from the Charity at the decision of the committee, for reasons including but not limited to:

* Serious misconduct of a personal or professional nature towards another member of the Python community. This extends to any other person providing services either to the Charity or to members on behalf of the Charity
* Serious misconduct of a personal or professional nature towards an external body, while acting as a representative of the Charity
* Any illegal activities conducted within the Charity
* Attempting to exploit or misuse the Charity or members of the Charity for pecuniary gain

A former member who has been expelled from the Charity for serious misconduct can only be re-admitted if a General Meeting approves that member’s return, by a majority vote of two thirds.

In addition to consequences of serious misconduct by a member, a committee member who is found to be in breach of the Code of Conduct at any level will immediately cease their office, and will be ineligible to sit on the committee for a period of two years, to be counted from the following AGM. If the member is President, Vice President, Treasurer or Secretary then a by-election will be held to fill the vacated position, unless the AGM is due to occur within two calendar months. If the period is less than two months the committee will nominate a replacement.

"Serious misconduct" is held at the discretion of the committee of the Charity, and any grievances should be brought before the committee.

The committee may review any member’s membership if they are prosecuted for a crime.

## Rule 5

The Rules of the Charity may be altered, added to or rescinded at an annual general meeting (AGM) or, in special circumstances, at a special meeting held for the purpose. These meetings will be conducted in accordance with Rule 6. Only members of the Charity can vote.

In either case, a vote is taken on each modification to the Rules, with a two-thirds majority indicating the successful modification to the Rules.

The president of the Charity (or acting president if the president is unable to be present) has a casting vote.

No addition to or alteration of the non-profit aims, personal benefit clause or the winding-up clause shall be approved without the approval of Inland Revenue.

The provisions and effect of this clause shall not be removed from this document and shall be included and implied into any document replacing this document.

## Rule 6

**Meetings**

Any meeting - including the AGM - may be conducted either in-person or online, and either synchronously or asynchronously, or any combination thereof.  The venue or method selected for the meeting must be clearly expressed beforehand and in all invitations.

A tentative agenda for the meeting will be circulated to all members of the Charity in the week before each meeting, and the resulting minutes will be similarly circulated as soon as practical after the meeting.

### Rule 6a

**General Meetings**

General Meetings must be announced to all current members via the Charity's direct email facilities, as well as any other current means of membership communication.  The first announcement must be made at least one month before the meeting; reminders shall be sent out at suitable intervals prior to the event using the same channels.

The Annual General Meeting (AGM) will be held in the first half of the financial year.  Special General Meetings (SGM) can occur at any time of the year.

An AGM will cover topics including but not limited to:

* The state of the Charity with respect to membership changes
* Methods to improve the standing or membership of the Charity in the following year
* The state of the Charity with respect to its finances
* Results of actions conducted by the Charity pursuant to the purposes and aims of the Charity outlined in Rule 2 above
* Methods to fulfill the purposes and aims of the Charity as outlined in Rule 2 above
* Changes to the charter or rules of the Charity

An SGM can be called to conduct any urgent Charity business that cannot wait until the AGM, and is of such significance that it requires the involvement of the all the members, including but not limited to:

* conducting any financial activity which cannot wait until the next general meeting
* disciplinary action to be taken against a Charity member
* changes to the charter or rules of the Charity
* any other matters requiring the attention of all members of the society which cannot wait until the next AGM

An SGM can be called at the request of any committee member.  Any member of the Charity may call an SGM if backed by at least 10% of the Charity's membership.

Any decisions to be made at a General Meeting will be made by vote.  The method of voting will be defined in the announcement of the General Meeting.  Only members who have paid their membership dues for the current financial year, OR were paid members in good standing in the financial year immediately preceding the General Meeting, are eligible to vote.

A simple majority will indicate the success of any motion put to vote, except in the cases specified in Rule 5. The president of the Charity (or the vice president in their absence) has a casting vote.  In the event of a draw, the motion must be deferred to a following General Meeting.

At a General Meeting, quorum shall be 50% of the Charity membership, or 15 people, whichever number is smaller.

### Rule 6b

**Committee Meetings**

The committee shall meet on a regular basis (at least 10 times a year), to discuss matters pertaining to the ongoing running of the Charity.  Only committee members may vote at a Committee Meeting, with quorum being four members of the committee.

If quorum is not reached after two attempts to convene a meeting, three Officers of the Charity - at least one of which must be the president or vice-president - may temporarily make quorum.  In this event, any decisions made must be unanimous, and the exercise of this power must be announced to the membership at each instance.

If a Charity member wishes to raise an issue at a committee meeting, they can give at least 3 business day’s notice to the Secretary, who will add the item to the agenda and invite the member to the meeting, if appropriate. Otherwise, attendance is restricted to committee members.

## Rule 7

The officers of the Charity shall consist of a president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer. The committee of the Charity shall include the above named officers, as well as up to 4 (four) extra members.

The officers and committee members shall be elected at an AGM or at a special meeting called for this purpose.
thr
Temporary replacements can be appointed at the discretion of the committee.

The standard term of appointment is one year, or until the next AGM, whichever is shorter. If a temporary position is appointed it will arise for reappointment with the other positions at the next AGM.

All officers must qualify under section 16 of the Charities Act, and corresponding forms must be signed to certify this.

## Rule 8

The common seal of the Charity shall be held with the secretary.

The seal can be used to verify documents on behalf of the Charity, either by the committee or officers of the committee at an AGM or special meeting, or by the president of the Charity if they deem it appropriate.

## Rule 9

The funds of the Charity shall be held under the control of the officers of the committee. The treasurer and secretary shall have joint required signing rights, and operate the bank accounts, handle investments, and make payments as needed.

For the purpose of online credit/debit card payments - which require a bank account with a single signatory - a separate bank account can be operated by the treasurer alone. This account shall only be used for the purpose of making specific payments via credit/debit card, and only receives the required funds from the jointly operated bank accounts when necessary.

Surplus funds, which are defined as being funds well in excess of the typical operating expenses of the Charity at the appropriate point in time can be invested, however no provision is made within the charter for this at the time of inception and should such a change be required it must be motioned at an AGM or at a special meeting called for this purpose.

No member of the organisation or any person associated with a member shall participate in or materially influence any decision made by the organisation in respect of the payment to or on behalf of that member or associated person of any income, benefit, or advantage whatsoever.

Any such income paid shall be reasonable and relative to that which would be paid in an arms length transaction (being the open market value). The provisions and effect of this clause shall not be removed from this document, and shall be included and implied into any document replacing this document.

## Rule 10

If the Charity ever needs to borrow money, the matter must be raised at a General Meeting for resolution. The purpose of the loan must be checked to ensure it lies within the objects of the Charity.

In this meeting, two proposals shall be voted upon: that the purpose is compatible with the objects of the Charity; and, separately, that the membership approves the Charity to seek the loan.

## Rule 11

If upon the winding up or dissolution of the New Zealand Python User Group (Incorporated) there remains after the satisfaction of all its debts and liabilities any property whatsoever the same shall not be paid to or distributed among the members of the Charity but shall be given or transferred to some other organisation or body having charitable objects similar to the objects of the New Zealand Python User Group (Incorporated), or to some other charitable organisation or purpose, within New Zealand.
